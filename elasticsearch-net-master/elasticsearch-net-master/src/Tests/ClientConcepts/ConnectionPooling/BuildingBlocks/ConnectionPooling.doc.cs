		/**[[connection-pooling]]
		 * === Connection pools
		 * Connection pooling is the internal mechanism that takes care of registering what nodes there are in the cluster and which
		 * NEST can use to issue client calls on.
         *
         * [IMPORTANT]
         * --
         * Despite the name, a connection pool in NEST is **not** like connection pooling that you may be familiar with from
         * https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb399543(v=vs.110).aspx[interacting with a database using ADO.Net]; for example,
         * a connection pool in NEST is **not** responsible for managing an underlying pool of TCP connections to Elasticsearch,
         * this is https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/adarshk/2005/01/02/understanding-system-net-connection-management-and-servicepointmanager/[handled by the ServicePointManager in Desktop CLR]
         * and can be controlled by <<servicepoint-behaviour,changing the ServicePoint behaviour>> on `HttpConnection`.
         * --
         *
         * So, what is a connection pool in NEST responsible for? It is responsible for managing the nodes in an Elasticsearch
         * cluster to which a connection can be made and there is one instance of an `IConnectionPool` associated with an
         * instance of `ConnectionSettings`. Since a <<lifetimes,single client and connection settings instance is recommended for the
         * life of the application>>, the lifetime of a single connection pool instance will also be bound to the lifetime
         * of the application.
         *
         * There are four types of connection pool
		 *
		 * - <<single-node-connection-pool,SingleNodeConnectionPool>>
		 * - <<static-connection-pool,StaticConnectionPool>>
		 * - <<sniffing-connection-pool,SniffingConnectionPool>>
		 * - <<sticky-connection-pool,StickyConnectionPool>>

		* sniffing or pinging behavior and will never mark nodes dead or alive. The one `Uri` it holds is always ready to go.
		*
