		*
		* If you are using an IOC/Dependency Injection container, it's always useful to know the best practices around
        * the lifetime of your objects.
		*
		* In general, we advise folks to register an `ElasticClient` instance as a singleton; the client is thread safe,
		* so sharing an instance across threads is fine.
		*
		* The actual moving part that benefits from being a singleton is `ConnectionSettings` because
		* **caches are __per__ `ConnectionSettings`**.
		*
		* In some applications ,it could make perfect sense to have multiple `ElasticClient` instances registered with different
		* connection settings such as when your application connects to two different Elasticsearch clusters.
		*
		* IMPORTANT: Due to the semantic versioning of Elasticsearch.Net and NEST and their alignment to versions of Elasticsearch, all instances of `ElasticClient` and
		* Elasticsearch clusters that are connected to must be on the **same major version**
		*
		* Let's demonstrate which components are disposed by creating our own derived `ConnectionSettings`, `IConnectionPool` and `IConnection` types
