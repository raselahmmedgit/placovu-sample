     * implementation uses
     *
     * - https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.webrequest(v=vs.110).aspx[`System.Net.WebRequest`] for Desktop CLR
     * - https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.http.httpclient(v=vs.118).aspx[`System.Net.Http.HttpClient`] for Core CLR
     *
     * The reason for different implementations is that `WebRequest` and `ServicePoint` are not directly available
     * on netstandard 1.3.
     *
     * The Desktop CLR implementation using `WebRequest` is the most mature implementation, having been tried and trusted
     * in production since the beginning of NEST. For this reason, we aren't quite ready to it give up in favour of
     * a `HttpClient` implementation across all CLR versions.
     *
     * In addition to production usage, there are also a couple of important toggles that are easy to set against a
     * `ServicePoint` that are not possible to set as yet on `HttpClient`.
     *
     * Finally, another limitation is that `HttpClient` has no synchronous code paths, so supporting these means
     * doing hacky async patches which definitely need time to bake.
     *
     * So why would you ever want to pass your own `IConnection`? Let's look at a couple of examples
