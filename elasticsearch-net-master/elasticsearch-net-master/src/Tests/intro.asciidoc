== Introduction

You've reached the documentation page for `Elasticsearch.Net` and `NEST`, The two official .NET clients for Elasticsearch.

=== Why two clients?

`Elasticsearch.Net` is a very low level, dependency free, client that has no opinions about how you build and represent your requests and responses. It has abstracted 
enough so that **all** the Elasticsearch API endpoints are represented as methods but not too much to get in the way of how you want to build 
your json/request/response objects. It also comes with built in, configurable/overridable, cluster failover retry mechanisms. Elasticsearch is _elastic_ so why not your client?

`NEST` is a high level client that has the advantage of having mapped all the request and response objects, 
comes with a strongly typed query DSL that maps 1 to 1 with the Elasticsearch query DSL, and takes advantage of specific .NET features such as 
<<covariant-search-results, covariant results>> and <<auto-map, auto mapping of POCOs>>. NEST internally uses and still exposes the low level `Elasticsearch.Net` client.

Please read the getting started guide for both <<elasticsearch-net,Elasticsearch.Net>> and <<nest,NEST>>.
