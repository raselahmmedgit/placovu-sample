=== Geo Shape Indexed Shape Query Usage

The GeoShape IndexedShape Query supports using a shape which has already been indexed in another index and/or index type within a geoshape query.
This is particularly useful for when you have a pre-defined list of shapes which are useful to your application and you want to reference this
using a logical name (for example __New Zealand__), rather than having to provide their coordinates within the request each time.

See the Elasticsearch documentation on {ref_current}/query-dsl-geo-shape-query.html[geoshape queries] for more detail.

==== Fluent DSL example

[source,csharp]
----
q
.GeoIndexedShape(c => c
    .Name("named_query")
    .Boost(1.1)
    .Field(p=>p.Location)
    .IndexedShape(p=>p
        .Id(2)
        .Path(pp=>pp.Location)
    )
    .Relation(GeoShapeRelation.Intersects)
)
----

==== Object Initializer syntax example

[source,csharp]
----
new GeoIndexedShapeQuery
{
    Name = "named_query",
    Boost = 1.1,
    Field = Field<Project>(p=>p.Location),
    IndexedShape = new FieldLookup
    {
        Id = 2,
        Index = Index<Project>(),
        Type = Type<Project>(),
        Path = Field<Project>(p=>p.Location),
    },
    Relation = GeoShapeRelation.Intersects
}
